### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ã–zgen from Istanbul/Turkey. \
I have a BSc degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from Bahcesehir University. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity Engine and C# Scripting. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a position as a Unity Developer. Hypercasual, casual, mid-core, VR, AR, AAA, edTech. I don't limit myself.

ðŸ“œ After I get confident in my skills, I want to learn more about VR development, network management(like photon network), Unity DOTS, other engines and languages, OpenGL, and machine learning.

ðŸ“š I am a self-learner. Always have been this way because I had undiagnosed ADHD in high school, so I was unfocused in some lecture hours and had to study them by myself afterward. Now that I am more aware of my ADHD, I can manage its effects more efficiently.

âš¡ Fun fact: I played a loooot of games. Action-adventure games and Metroidvania are my favorite. Nowadays, I generally don't play as much but I will be playing my backlog on my in queue Steam Deck. [My Steam Link.](https://steamcommunity.com/id/RootPith/)
