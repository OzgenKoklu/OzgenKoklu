### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ã–zgen from Istanbul/Turkey. \
I have a BSc degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from Bahcesehir University. 

I attended a master's program for NanoScience & Nanoengineering at Istanbul Technical University, and got all sorts of interdisciplinary courses including Computational Nanoelectronics or Nanofabrication methods.  When I started the program in 2019, my long-term career plans included the pursuit of a Ph.D. and research-centric jobs in the biomedical/translational medicine industries.  

During my thesis term, I realized that the conditions for working in the university as a researcher were not as I expected, the worst part was bad project management, where you had to do many things that were completely unrelated to your study and were completely out of your task backlog. I lost my motivation to complete my master's or pursue a Ph.D. I know conditions well differ from University to University or even laboratory to laboratory, but from anecdotal data, I think this is the general pattern.

In November 2021 I bought an Oculus Quest 2 just to play Resident Evil 4 VR. For years, I've been playing hundreds of games on dozens of hardware, but nothing impressed me as much as a VR headset. Unsure of my road ahead, I said to myself "Why don't I make VR experiences for a living?". Obviously, I could not jump directly to VR development without any prior experience on game development. I already knew I had two options, Unreal or Unity. As I was familiar with Java from earlier, Unity that uses C# -which is similar to Java in many ways- looked like a great starting point. In late November, I got accepted to an Academy called ["Oyun ve Uygulama akademisi" ](https://oyunveuygulamaakademisi.com/) which was in a nutshell an academy to teach basics of game or application development, as well as foundational knowledge on entrepreneurship, MVP's, project management, and much more on startups.

So here I am, with all the math-centric courses I've taken in undergrad/grad study, Google Project management certificate, and fundamental Unity/C# knowledge, I think I can be a great candidate for a JR game developer job position. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity Engine and C# Scripting. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a position in game development using Unity Engine. Hypercasual, casual, mid-core, VR, AR, AAA. I don't limit myself.

ðŸ“œ After I get confident in my skills, I want to learn more about VR development, network management(like photon network), Unity DOTS, other engines and languages, OpenGL, and machine learning.

ðŸ“š I am a self-learner. Always have been this way because I had undiagnosed ADHD in high school, so I was unfocused in some lecture hours and had to study them by myself afterward. Now that I am more aware of my ADHD, I can manage its effects more efficiently.

âš¡ Fun fact: I played a loooot of games. Action-adventure games and Metroidvania are my favorite. Nowadays, I generally don't play as much but I will be playing my backlog on my in queue Steam Deck. [My Steam Link.](https://steamcommunity.com/id/RootPith/)
